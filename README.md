### 1. Get the data using Selenium

- Selenium Liga & Mannschaft

### 2. Get the Widget IDs from urls

- Widget ID Liga and Mannschaft .py

### 3. Generate Code

- Using the data we generate the code snippets for the widgets

### 4. Save as Excel

- Use the Excel Liga and Manschaft .py to export it to a Excel file

## Generate Widgets

### 1. Using Input.txt

- Save the data in `input.txt` file
- Run `WP Tabs Input.py`

### 2. Using Console.txt

- Run `WP Tabs Input.py`
- Enter the data when asked

### 3. Using existing presets

- See `output/presets`
- These presets are auto generated with the other methods
- Autocreates all the widgets that exist from the presets

> [!Important]
> Open the Excel files and check there for the Index of the Widgets (Liga, Mannschaft)

### Extra

- What I did is you can put two widgets next to each other, but that doesn't work for mobile which is why i deleted it!
- If you only want to see games not table, the is a single folder in output/single, which is not optimized
